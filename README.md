# Too Hungry to Decide
A random topping generator for all pizza lovers alike! If you love pizza, this app is surely something that you'll....wanna sink your teeth in to.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Figma, JavaScript, Node.js (Express.js coming soon!)

A full stack application using a Node server to retrieve the information that is then displayed on the UI which was styled with basic HTML and CSS. The challenge was to create a server bare-bones (no frameworks or anything of that nature), so this is how the project was created. We implemented the base requirements in order for this application to run server-side (http, fs, ur, querystring) and even figlet (for the default 404 page). The server was created using the .createServer method and inside, since there were so many toppings to iterate through, a switch statement was used to cover the various amount of toppings (created in Figma) that were to be shown on the actual pizza. A function containing the names of those toppings were put in to arrays and following that, depending on the amount that is entered on the UI, the number of toppings will appear. This operation was handled with a combination of "if-else" and "while" statements. 

## Optimizations

- We plan to refactor the back end using Express.js for readability and efficiency.
- Style and design may be changed just for better visual appeal.
- Could possibly be revised in to a React project since this project is more involved. 

## Lessons Learned:

Quite a few things were learned in this project. For one, we learned that Github version control was super important for handling forks from each contributor and we learned shortcuts insofar as how to use Git version control. Secondly, we learned the reason WHY express is a neccessity, as this was quite the challenge to complete with just bare-bones node.js. Finally, we learned about the importance of communicating with each other effectively, especially when changes were being made. We all listened to each other's inputs and reasonings, and we provided feedback whnever a member of the group needed it.
